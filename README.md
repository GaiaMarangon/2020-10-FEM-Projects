# 2020-10-FEM-Projects

This Repo collects two projects on Finite Element Methods for pdes, implemented in ```MATLAB```.

- the *"Stokes"* project implements the Stokes boundary value problem. It includes:
  - the *"Manufactured Problem"*, testing the convergence of three different FEM implementations (three different choices of basis functions) on a manufactured solution
  - the *"Lid-Driven Cavity Problem"*, applying the implemented methods to a specific case of the Stokes boundary value problem.
- the *"Conv-Diff"* project implements the Convection-Diffusion boundary value problem.

Both project include a *report* detailing the mathematical construction, the code structure and the numerical results.
