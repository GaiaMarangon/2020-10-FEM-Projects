# 2020-10-FEM-Projects

This Repo collects two projects on Finite Element Methods for pdes, implemented in MATLAB.

- the "Stokes" project implements the Stokes boundary value problem. In includes:
  - the "Manufactured Problem", testing the convergence of three different FEM implementations (three different choices of basis functions) on a manufactured solution
  - the "Lid-Driven Cavity Problem", applying the implemented methods to a specific case of the Stokes boundary value problem.
